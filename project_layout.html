									<p class="large-text-2">LinkedIn as a pivotal platform where companies and individuals seeking connections and job opportunities.
									Many of college students have faced certain difficulties with being hired and in career progression. My teammates and I felt that exploring data on LinkedIn could help to provide insight not only to the topic as a whole, but on a professional level as well. Analyzing this data will give us an idea of <strong>what the job market really looks like and how one might be able to navigate it more effectively</strong>. For our team project, we utilized <strong>Google Drive and GitHub</strong> as our collaboration platforms. The website was developed from the ground up. The final product incorporates<strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python</strong>.</p>

									<h2>1. Identify the Problem</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Clearly Define the Problem:</strong> Start by understanding what the problem is. Be specific about the issue at hand. For example, instead of saying, "Sales are down," clarify whether the problem is with a specific product, market segment, or sales process.</p>

									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Collect relevant data and information to understand the problem better. This could involve looking at financial reports, customer feedback, sales data, or other relevant metrics.</p>
									
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Involve Stakeholders:</strong> Engage with people who are affected by the problem or who have insights into it. This could include employees, customers, suppliers, or other stakeholders.</p>


								
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>2. Analyze the Problem</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Identify the Root Cause:</strong> Use tools like the <strong>5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa), or Pareto Analysis</strong> to dig deeper and find the underlying cause of the problem.</p>
									
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Break Down the Problem:</strong> Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable components to better understand it. This could involve categorizing the problem into different areas such as people, processes, technology, etc.</p>
									
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Assess the Impact:</strong> Determine the severity of the problem and its impact on the business. This will help prioritize which problems need immediate attention.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. Develop Possible Solutions</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Brainstorm Solutions:</strong> Involve a team to brainstorm potential solutions. Encourage creativity and think of as many ideas as possible, even if some seem unconventional.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Evaluate Solutions:</strong> Assess the feasibility, cost, time, and resources required for each potential solution. Consider both short-term and long-term impacts.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Prioritize Solutions:</strong> Rank the solutions based on their potential effectiveness, ease of implementation, and alignment with business goals.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. Select the Best Solution</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Choose the Most Viable Solution:</strong> Based on your evaluation, select the solution that best addresses the root cause of the problem and is practical to implement.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Develop an Action Plan:</strong> Create a detailed plan for implementing the solution. This should include specific actions, timelines, responsibilities, and resources needed.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>5. Implement the Solution</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Communicate the Plan:</strong> Ensure that everyone involved understands the solution and their role in implementing it. Clear communication is key to successful implementation.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Execute the Plan:</strong> Put the solution into action according to the plan. Monitor progress closely to ensure that everything is going according to schedule.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Manage Change:</strong> Address any resistance to change by involving key stakeholders, providing training, and offering support throughout the implementation process.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>6. Monitor and Evaluate</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Continuously monitor the implementation to ensure the solution is working as expected. Use KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or other metrics to measure success.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Evaluate the Outcome:</strong> Assess the effectiveness of the solution by comparing the results with the initial objectives. Determine whether the problem has been resolved or if further adjustments are needed.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Gather Feedback:</strong> Collect feedback from stakeholders involved in or affected by the implementation. This will help identify any issues or areas for improvement.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>7. Make Adjustments if Necessary</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Identify Areas for Improvement:</strong> If the solution didnâ€™t fully resolve the problem or if new issues arise, revisit the analysis and adjust the solution accordingly.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Refine the Process:</strong> Learn from the experience and refine the problem-solving process for future challenges. Document lessons learned and best practices.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>8. Document and Share Learnings</h2>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Record the Process:</strong> Document the steps taken, the solutions considered, and the final outcome. This can be valuable for solving similar problems in the future.</p>
									<p class="large-text-2"><strong>Share Knowledge:</strong> Communicate the results and lessons learned with relevant teams or departments to build organizational knowledge and improve overall problem-solving capabilities.</p>
